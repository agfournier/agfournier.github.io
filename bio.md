Abelardo Gil-Fournier (Spain, 1979) is an artist and researcher, born in Salé (Morocco) and based in Madrid. Originally trained in Physics, he holds a PhD in Arts from the Winchester School of Art (UK). He currently works at FAMU Prague (Czech Republic) as part of the project Operational Images and Visual Culture and is a member of AMT Archaeologies of Media and Technology.

<p>
His practice addresses the entwining of image surfaces with the living crust of the planet. In his work, images are understood as temporal processes operating through manifolds of varied materiality while involving different scales at the same time. As a consequence of this, his work encompasses different techniques, spanning from sound and video installations to computational processes such as machine learning, including assemblages where the living conflates with the animate. 
</p>

<p>
His work has been shown and discussed in international venues such as Transmediale (Berlin), Medialab Prado (Madrid), Strelka Institute (Moscow), Galeria Millenium (Lisbon), Fotomuseum Winterthur (Switzerland), MUSAC and Fundación Cerezales Antonino y Cinia (León), Le Bal (Paris), Fotocolectania (Barcelona), NeMe Center of Art (Cyprus), IKKM (Weimar), Matadero Center of Art (Madrid), Laboral Center of Art (Gijón) as well as in Cultural Centers of Spain in Mexico, Nicaragua and El Salvador.

Together with Jussi Parikka, he is currently working on a book on vegetal surfaces and the multi-scalar materialities of the image.
