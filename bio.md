Abelardo Gil-Fournier (Spain, 1979) is an artist and researcher, born in Salé (Morocco) and based in Madrid. Originally trained in Physics, he holds a PhD in Art from Winchester School of Art (UK).

His practice addresses the entwining of image surfaces with the living crust of the planet. In his work, images are understood as temporal processes that operate through multiple and varied materialities, while involving different scales. As a consequence, his work encompasses different techniques, spanning from sound and video installations to computational processes such as machine learning, including assemblages where the living conflates with the animate.

His work has been exhibited and discussed in international spaces such as Transmediale (Berlin), Fundación Cerezales Antonino y Cinia (León), Fotomuseum Winterthur (Switzerland), Le Bal (Paris), Fotocolectania (Barcelona), Galeria Millenium (Lisbon), Medialab Prado (Madrid), Strelka Institute (Moscow), MUSAC (León), NeMe Center of Art (Cyprus), Centrjo de arte Matadero (Madrid), Laboral centro de arte (Gijón) as well as in Spanish Cultural Centres in Mexico, Nicaragua and El Salvador.
