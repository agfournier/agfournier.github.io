Following the concepts discussed in the presentation of the documentary "Hello World! Processing", this workshop will explore in detail the creation of living-like responsive environments. Through the introduction to algorithms coming from the simulation of natural and artificial phenomena, such as Vector Fields and Graphs, this workshop will be focused in the complexification of interaction and the composition of systems, two key issues to explore critically and creatively in our increasingly algorithmic driven world.
