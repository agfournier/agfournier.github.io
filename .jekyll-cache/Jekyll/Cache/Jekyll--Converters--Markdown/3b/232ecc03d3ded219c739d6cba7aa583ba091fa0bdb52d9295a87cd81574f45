I"ø<p>Iâ€™ve been selected to participate in this Summer School. Broadly, the notion of cultural techniques will be discussed in relation to its algorithmisation. As this yearâ€™s topic of the summer school states:</p>

<p>â€œHow does the computerization of cultural techniques produce new forms of subjectivity? As the concept of cultural techniques implies already the notion of â€œchains of operationsâ€ and thereby a permanent (retro-)coupling of human and nonhuman agency, how does the technologization and computerization of cultural techniques change the very nature of knowing, of affect, of being-with-others (people, things, animals)?â€</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll contribute to it with my research on the interweaving of imaging practices and vegetal growth.</p>
