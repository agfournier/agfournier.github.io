Together with Jussi Parikka, I am part of the guest faculty of the <a href="https://theterraforming.strelka.com/">Terraforming 2022</a> design research program at Strelka Institute in Moscow. During the seminar, "The Surface as a Method" we discussed practice-led examples such as our recent video essay Seed, Image, Ground (2020) as they relate to the question of aerial view, surface and technological operations. We are interested in using surfaces to address remote sensing, turning the question upside down: how does remote sensing look like when investigated from the perspective of the surfaces that are sensed? In which ways can we think of surfaces as methodsâ€“operationalised into interesting, speculative, grounded ways of knowing?
