Spent two wonderful days working on the topic of Common Sensing with Susan Schuppli, Lukas Likavcan, Sam Nightingale, Roisin Agnew and the group of researchers from and visiting the Center for Research in Architecture at Goldsmiths. It was an extraordinary opportunity to present and discuss ideas from our forthcoming book, Living Surfaces, with Jussi Parikka and my ongoing exhibition at the Fundaci√≥n Cerezales Antonino y Cinia.
