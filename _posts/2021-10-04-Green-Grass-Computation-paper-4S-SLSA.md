We (Jussi Parikka and I) will present our paper on "Green Grass Computation" in two different contexts this month: at the SLSA 2021 conference on the topic on "Energy", and at the 4S annual meeting (Good Relations) as part of a series of panels on Computing and Critique beyond Disciplinary Configurations, being the last one organised and coordinated by Th√©o Lepage-Richer and Ranjodh Singh Dhaliwal.
