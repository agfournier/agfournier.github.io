The <a href="https://networkcultures.org/events/violence-visibility-in-computational-regimes-jcu-conference-in-rome/">international seminar</a> organized by the Department of Communications and Media Studies, John Cabot University (coordinated by Donatella Della Ratta), in collaboration with Duke University and The Institute of Network Cultures took place the 24 and 25 of March this year.

Due to my paternity leave, I participated with a recorded presentation, "An atmospheric belt of turbulent shadows", that responded to the questions addressed by the seminar: <em>The What does it mean to study the interplay between violence and visibility in computational regimes? How does that dynamic change, both in war-torn contexts and within the silent confines of our digital devices, as data capitalism extracts value from everything and everyone at the infrastructural level of metadata? How can we conceptualize these emerging and well-camouflaged forms of infrastructural violence?</em>
