The new video essay <a href="works/seedimageground.html">Seed, Image, Ground</a> is part of our collaborative work with Jussi Parikka emerging from our project on vegetal surfaces and media aesthetics. Launched today, the video was commissioned by Fotomuseum Winterthur as part of their cluster <a href="https://www.fotomuseum.ch/en/explore/situations/clusters/157048">Situations/Strike</a>.
