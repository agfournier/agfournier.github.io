Humboldt University's Cluster of Excellence <a href="https://www.matters-of-activity.de/en/">Matters of Activity</a> organizes its annual conference, <a href="https://www.matters-of-activity.de/en/">Out of Hand. Active, Ambiguous and Unsteady Matters</a>, on the 19 Sep from 9am to 9pm. Honoured to participate together with Jussi Parikka in a panel on Ecologies of Light and the screening of our last film <a href="https://abelardogfournier.org/works/lumi.html">Lumi</a>.

From the conference's site: 

"In the face of the current ecological predicament, substantial ›matters‹ are progressively getting ›out of hand‹ and require critical attention to their environmental, technological, and socio-material ambiguities. The annual conference of »Matters of Activity«, attends to such complexities by intertwining material activities on multiple scales with questions of modeling, making, and playing on unsteady grounds. By convening a variety of interdisciplinary positions, we seek to inspire collaborative means to negotiate the legacies and futures of material-driven research.

We are delighted to welcome a distinguished group of speakers who will join us for the full day on 19 September at silent green Kulturquartier, as part of the ＿matter Festival 2025. We are especially honored that Karen Barad (UC Santa Cruz) has accepted our invitation to deliver the evening keynote.

Throughout the entire day, we will host four panels that will connect a wide range of interdisciplinary perspectives, to be activated through our international panelists in dialogue with Cluster members.

Our international panel speakers are: Philip Beesley (University of Waterloo), Xan Chacko (Brown University), Hélène Frichot (Melbourne School of Design), Abelardo Gil-Fournier (BBVA Foundation Scholar), Jussi Parikka (Aarhus University), Thao Phan (Australian National University), and Joachim Heberle (Freie Universität Berlin).

We very much look forward to the inspiring exchanges emerging from these contributions!

The conference is organised by cluster members Bastian Beyer, José D. Cojal González, Léa Perraudin, and Christian Stein."

When: 19 Sep 9am to 9pm
