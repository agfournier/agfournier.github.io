From <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mater________/">their instagram profile</a>: As a Mutely Vibrating Consonant: ‘Since the 19th century, the schlieren (German for “impurities”) technique has made it possible to see and photograph minute optical disturbances such as those caused by temperature differences in the air in a room. Since then it has been used to visualise air currents and to trace their paths inside models of buildings, wind tunnels or in medical imaging.

Co-produced by the Foundation Cerezales Antonino y Cinia and the Academy of Musical and Performing Arts in Prague, the installation - which takes its name from the poem Schliere im Aug by Paul Celan - presents the elements that make up this mechanism (parabolic mirrors, spotlights, lenses and projection screens) in a space open to the wandering of visitors. While walking between the silk screens and bamboo tutors, the movement of the bodies generates currents that these same devices visualise. In between, like a sustained exhalation in time, gazes and air currents - body and image - dissolve, like a silent, vibrating consonant.’

Abelardo speaks with #JussiParikka on this week’s episode of The Mater Podcast, about data and images.
