On the 4th and 5th of November I have participated in the symposium <a href="https://www.ncad.ie/news/view/foraging-media-eco-materialist-media-practices-in-a-digital-era">Foraging Media</a>, organized by the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/frugalmediaresearchgroup/">Frugal Media research group</a> of the the National College of Art & Design in Dublin. I've talked about our book with Jussi Parikka and its relation to my practice during the last years. Other participants include Kim Knowles, Cliona Harmey and Radek Przedpelski. The symposium included a screening of 16mm films and a phytography workshop by Karel Doing.
