I've been selected to participate in this Summer School. Broadly, the notion of cultural techniques will be discussed in relation to its algorithmisation. As this year's topic of the summer school states:

"How does the computerization of cultural techniques produce new forms of subjectivity? As the concept of cultural techniques implies already the notion of "chains of operations" and thereby a permanent (retro-)coupling of human and nonhuman agency, how does the technologization and computerization of cultural techniques change the very nature of knowing, of affect, of being-with-others (people, things, animals)?"

I'll contribute to it with my research on the interweaving of imaging practices and vegetal growth.
