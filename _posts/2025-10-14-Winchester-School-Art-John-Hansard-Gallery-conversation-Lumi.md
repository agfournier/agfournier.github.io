A screening of Lumi and conversation between Jussi Parikka and Abelardo Gil-Fournier on the audiovisual photoessay will be held at the Winchester School of Art. The <a href="https://jhg.art/events/lumi-in-conversation/">event, organised by the John Hansard Gallery</a>, is presented with the following text:

*Shown at John Hansard Gallery earlier this year, and soon to be on display as part of the Lisbon Architecture Triennale (from 2 October), LUMI (2024) explores snow, luminosity, and the reflections of planetary light. Explored through the lens of climate and science fiction, the film presents a compelling narrative.*

*Within the film, ‘artificial agents’ travel through time. They use photographic images from the past to recreate future programmed landscapes. Historical photographic material is examined from the perspective of an imaginary synthetic intelligence. This AI repaints the landscape as part of a climate restoration effort. At the centre of the operation is the ‘albedo effect’: a measure of reflection of light as it hits a surface. This enables the mapping and simulation of ice and snow covered landscapes that have disappeared over time.*
