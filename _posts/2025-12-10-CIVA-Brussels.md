"This event explores the architectures, imaginaries, and geopolitical implications of quantum technologies, data infrastructures, and planetary-scale computation. It unfolds in two parts: an afternoon film screening and panel discussion, followed by an evening keynote lecture. The program aims to bridge artistic research, scientific insight, and speculative design, aligning with EUROPALIA’s commitment to cultural inquiry and transdisciplinary dialogue. It seeks to contribute to current cultural debates on infrastructural aesthetics, techno-political futures, and the ethics of innovation."
