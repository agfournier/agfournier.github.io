We'll be somehow in Shenzhen next week (not physically however) for the opening of the exhibition "Vibrating Clouds" curated by Yixuan Cai. We are looking forward to seeing images of the first setup of Seed, Image, Ground (with Jussi Parikka) as a video installation with two synchronised large projections. The venue is Fumihiko Maki's building, Design Society. The dates, from April 30 to July 18: <a href="http://www.designsociety.cn/en">www.designsociety.cn/en</a>
