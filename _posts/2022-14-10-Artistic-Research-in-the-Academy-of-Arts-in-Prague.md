The <a href="https://www.amu.cz/en/">Academy of Performative Arts in Prague (AMU)</a> has selected among other projects my invitation to think in terms of mirrors and heat the relation between image and climate. The result of this one-year art research project is to be presented in the next show at the <a href="https://fundacioncerezalesantoninoycinia.org/en/">Fundaci√≥n Cerezales Antonino y Cinia</a>.
