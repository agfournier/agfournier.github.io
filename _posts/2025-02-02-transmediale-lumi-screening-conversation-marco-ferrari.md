The interaction between light and landscape manifests through various technological mediations: from surveyors depending on the reflection and refraction of light to trace the edges of landscapes, to satellite images capturing atmospheric radiation. These observations generate different forms of representation – annotated photographs, algorithmic classifications, and composite images – each revealing how landscapes both draw themselves through natural phenomena and are drawn through human and technological intervention.

<a href="https://transmediale.de/en/event/synthetic-surfaces-and-planetary-light">Coming together in conversation, Marco Ferrari, Abelardo Gil-Fournier, and Jussi Parikka</a> discuss these synthetic landscapes, examining how moving images serve as a methodology for investigating distance, proximity, and elemental media. Their conversation reveals the evolution from analog to digital perception of landscapes while exploring the tensions between ahistorical landscape representation and human presence in images. The discussion ultimately frames landscape recognition as a complex interplay between questions of scale and measurement, of natural phenomena, and technological mediation.
