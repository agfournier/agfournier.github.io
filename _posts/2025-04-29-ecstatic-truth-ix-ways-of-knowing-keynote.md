I have been invited to participate as keynote of the Ecstatic Truth IX symposium organized by <a href="https://tangibleterritory.art/">Tangible Territory</a> which delved into the dynamic intersections of artistic research, practice as research, and expanded documentary forms: "We aim to explore how knowledge is produced and what it means to truly know something in the context of creative practices. How do we engage in processes of knowing, deeply and intimately, through sensory, embodied, and experiential methods? How do these processes of research—whether in audio-visual media, animation, or documentary—transform our relationship with the world and shape the forms through which we communicate our findings?"
