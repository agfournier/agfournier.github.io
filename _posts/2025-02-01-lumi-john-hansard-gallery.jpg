We premiere our latest video essay, LUMI, in the UK at the John Hansard Gallery in Southampton. Although the piece has been in the gallery since 14 January, the public presentation will take place on 7 February, along with the rest of the exhibitions:

From <a href="https://jhg.art/events/abelardo-gil-fournier-and-jussi-parikka-lumi/">their website</a>: "LUMI explores snow, luminosity, and the reflections of planetary light. Explored through the lens of climate and science fiction, the film presents a compelling narrative.

Within the film, ‘artificial agents’ travel through time. They use photographic images from the past to recreate future programmed landscapes. Historical photographic material is examined from the perspective of an imaginary synthetic intelligence. This AI repaints the landscape as part of a climate restoration effort. At the centre of the operation is the ‘albedo effect’: a measure of reflection of light as it hits a surface. This enables the mapping and simulation of ice and snow covered landscapes that have disappeared over time.

LUMI serves as a visual database, capturing the dynamic interplay of snow, ice, and light. It tells a story about the reversal of time and the formation of landscapes: once made, then remade."
