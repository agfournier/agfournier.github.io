On Tuesday 9 July, Lancaster Universityâ€™s School of Arts and the Future Places Centre invite you to an evening exploring how data shapes our relationship with place, environment, and the future.

Cultivating Data Natures brings together internationally renowned contributors in a lively, interdisciplinary setting. The event is presented in partnership with Abandon Normal Devices, Deco Publique, and Lancaster Arts, and marks the closing celebration of the Future Places Centreâ€”Lancaster Universityâ€™s interdisciplinary hub for experimental research into data, design, and environmental futures.

The theme of cultivation runs throughout the evening as a research and innovation method. We want to ask how we tend to data, how we nurture new imaginaries, and how we grow more just, sustainable, and imaginative relationships between people, technology, and the natural world.

Wednesday 9 July 2025 | 7:00â€“9:30pm | Nuffield Theatre, Lancaster University

*Event Highlights*

Jonathan Gray â€“ Public Data Cultures

Drawing from his forthcoming book (Polity, October 2025), Gray offers a radical rethinking of public data as cultural and political material. Rather than framing data simply as a resource to be opened or protected, he argues for forms of public data practice rooted in care, participation, and solidarityâ€”essential for making sense of todayâ€™s interconnected social and ecological crises.

BRiGHTBLACK â€“ Gardeners of the 5th Industrial Revolution

A performance lecture set in a speculative future where artificial intelligence has liberated humanity from labour. In the GrowDome, the audience joins a group of post-labour gardeners navigating fossils, simulations, and hybrid consciousnesses to reimagine ecological life in a future Morecambe Bay. Combining storytelling, game engines, and participatory dialogue, BRiGHTBLACK ask: who are we becoming?

LUMI â€“ Film by Abelardo Gil-Fournier & Jussi Parikka

A synthetic intelligence is trained on historical landscape photography in an attempt to repaint the Earth for climate repair. LUMI is a meditative video essay on snow, light, memory and machine visionâ€”a planetary fiction that poses urgent questions about time, perception, and the aesthetics of environmental data.

*ABOUT THE PRESENTERS*

BRiGHTBLACK is a company of two artists Myra Appannah and Simon Wilkinson, from POC / neurodiverse backgrounds whose works have toured to 36 nations on 5 continents over the last decade from Tate Modern to an abandoned toilet in the Arizona desert. We explore the radical potential of immersive technologies to create artworks which aim to disrupt, democratise and decolonise, giving power back to the individual and their communities.

Jonathan Gray is a researcher, writer and educator working at the intersection of media, culture, and politics. He is Senior Lecturer in Critical Infrastructure Studies at Kingâ€™s College London and co-founder of the Public Data Lab. His work explores how data is made publicâ€”socially, technically, and materiallyâ€”and how it is entangled with issues of democracy, participation, and care. Jonathan is the author of Data Worlds: A Social Life of Data (with Danny LÃ¤mmerhirt and Liliana Bounegru, MIT Press, 2024) and the forthcoming Public Data Cultures (Polity, 2025), which examines the cultural and political practices involved in making data meaningful and consequential. His research spans public data infrastructures, data journalism, digital methods, and the aesthetics and politics of evidence. He has collaborated widely with artists, designers, journalists, and technologists to explore the civic potential of data in addressing social and environmental challenges.

Abelardo Gil-Fournier is an artist and researcher whose work explores the visual cultures of environmental transformation, technological vision, and the politics of landscape. Working across film, photography, and critical theory, his practice investigates how planetary processes are mediated through images, data, and machines. Gil-Fournierâ€™s work has been exhibited and presented internationally, and he frequently collaborates with theorist Jussi Parikka on projects at the intersection of art, media archaeology, and environmental aesthetics. Their film LUMI, featured in this event, offers a speculative vision of climate restoration through synthetic intelligence and landscape datasets.

*About the Partners*
