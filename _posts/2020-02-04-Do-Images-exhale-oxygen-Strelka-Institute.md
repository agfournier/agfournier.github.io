As part of the new education program <a href="https://theterraforming.strelka.com/">The Terraforming</a> at <a  href="https://strelka.com/">Strelka Institute</a> in Moscow, I will contribute with an online lecture in the context of a course lead by Jussi Parikka on the speculative topic of a Natural History of Logistics and Infrastructure.
