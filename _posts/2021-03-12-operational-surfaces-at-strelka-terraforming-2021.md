Together with Jussi Parikka, we will participate as guest faculty in the year two of The Terraforming program at the Strelka Institute in Moscow. Our online seminar (March 16-17) will deal with the notion of the Operational Surface, which leads to discussions on imaging, scale and growth and the interweaving of systhetic imaginagions as surfaces in the planet.
