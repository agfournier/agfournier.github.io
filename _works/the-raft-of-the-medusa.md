<p><em>The Raft of the Medusa</em> consists of a series of oil on canvases. Each canvas in the
series, a selection of seascapes by mainly nineteenth-century artists,
reproduces only the horizon line from the original painting. The line of the horizon
is doubled, however. Two parallel lines, separated by a barely noticeable
distance—below one milimeter—refer to the impact that a 3-degree planetary
temperature rise will have on the ocean level horizon.</p>

<p>Displaying the same interruptions of the horizon line in the original painting, the
doubled horizon brought to the foreground becomes a kind of data register of the
bodies in the pictured scene. This function of the horizon as an autograph is
presented together with its doubling: while the historicity of the height of the
ocean horizon in relation to climate change turns potentially every seascape of
the past into a measure of historical sea level data, this transformation assumes
images to be data-images as well. The scale of planetary time meets human visual
histories through the datification of the image.</p>
